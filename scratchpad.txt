bug: not mine though, it's JavaFx's one if I am right.
    - when new item is added with a item selected in listview, list view throws a null pointer exception

should model be created each time the controller is constructed or it should be passed on?
    - for this simple app this does not matter.
    - for this app, I am just passing same model.

NOTES:

I do not know what happened in DependencyInjectionTest when i swapped MainSceneController with TestController.
    - Now it does not require require Toolkit to be initialized.
    - Meaning Platform.start() & Platform.exit() can be removed. WOW.

note the difference between callable and callback. In DependencyInjection class.

I think Mockito have more understandability that JMock. Surely, Jmock have greater readability but
if I see Mockito also have decent readability with much more understandability.

I think Mockito reports the test failure in much understanding and readable way than JMock.
